Online, practical, and intensive training. We use NodeJS, ReactJS, and React Native and them whole ecosystem, from zero to deployment. Including automated testing, seamless integration, store publishing, and all the important libraries, tools, and frameworks for those who want to be ready for the projects of the real world.
